# Welcome to DoctorGo project

## Project info
practical user-first app that connects patients to
nearby doctors and clinics, allows users to join queues in
real-time or book appointments, supports secure online
payment, and uses a lightweight AI recommender to
suggest the best provider for a particular situation. The goal
is to solve the real problems people face today: long waits,
unclear costs, inefficient queue management and to raise
the efficiency of management of clinics and medical
centers.
